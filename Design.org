* Basic elements

  Org-mode has a few different basic elements

*** Blocks

    Blocks are the largest element and are multi-line elements. These
    include tables, lists, properties, and the various blocks (quote,
    example, source, dynamic).  Headlines and corresponding following
    body text are also block elements.



*** Lines

    The next level of detail is lines.  Much of mode structuring
    can be done with line elements.  These include headlines, example
    lines, regular text, in-buffer settings


*** Inline elements

    The lowest level of detail is inline elements.  These give the
    formatting flavors, links, tags, and footnotes
